<h2>Survival Hunter(생존)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/survival-hunter-guide" target="_blank" title="Survival Hunter specification"><strong>The Survival Hunter</strong></a> is a <strong><u>brutal</u> melee combatant</strong>, abandoning ranged weapons for closer combat, facing enemies eye-to-eye. Survival revolves around the core rotation of  Serpent Sting,  Kill Command,  Raptor Strike and  Wildfire Bomb. The core gameplay is to generate Focus with  Kill Command while maintaining  Serpent Sting and spending excess on  Raptor Strike. This can get a bit more complex when using some of the talent combinations, but generally doesn't add extra buttons to your rotation.

<p>Survival has unique Mastery. Not only does it increase your damage, but it also increases your survival with constant passive healing. However, it is important to remember that while Survival also heavily depends on pets like Beast Mastery, it is still unable to tame Exotics pets. Furthermore, you can use your  Aspect of the Turtle to immune dangerous abilities, or  Feign Death to make enemies lose interest in you.
