<h2>Beast Mastery(야수)</h2>
<P><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/beast-mastery-hunter-guide" target="_blank" title="Beast Mastery specification"><strong>Beast Mastery Hunter</strong></a> in Shadowlands is a fantastic spec that uses its ferocious animal companions to ravage foes, fulfilling a unique and well-defined class fantasy. If you are looking for an extremely mobile ranged DPS with tons of utility and a strong, pet-based class identity, then consider giving it a try.

<p>Possibly the biggest attraction to playing Beast Mastery is the spec's mobility. Beast Mastery is the only ranged DPS specialization in the game that can do 100% of its damage while moving, with no restrictions whatsoever. This provides a huge benefit in any sort of PvE content, as you can always do mechanics or deal with whatever is going on without ever needing to waste any damage, something no other ranged DPS can do. Combining their mobility with incredible spells like  Aspect of the Turtle, Beast Mastery Hunters are perfect for doing odd-jobs and any sort of mechanical challenges that raids and dungeons might present.
