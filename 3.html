    <h2>Marksmanship(사격)</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/marksmanship-hunter-guide" target="_blank" title="Marksmanship Hunter specification"><strong>Marksmanship Hunters</strong></a> are the only Hunter spec that have the option of not using a pet. It's typically the go-to spec for any player that does not like using or managing pets, but still want to play Hunter. It's typically referred to as the "sniper" spec with slower, heavy-hitting shots and an extended range. In Shadowlands, Marksmanship has transitioned into a more bursty class, having a "Burst and Reload" type feeling to its rotation.

<p>At its core, Marksmanship uses  Aimed Shot to enable  Precise Shots while using abilities such as  Rapid Fire and  Steady Shot to regenerate Focus. Our talents such as  Explosive Shot and  Volley give us some burst AoE potential, which is a nice change of pace compared to BFA. For the most part, though, Marksmanship plays very similarly to how it did in BFA with a few minor tweaks.
